The project aims to give an overview of a deployable structure and its elements through transitioning phases with flexibility in adding and/or removing certain elements

## Plugin
- Kangaroo Physics (for one aspect only, not completely relying on it)

## Data Flow
- **Expansion Phase**: Deployment apertures
- **Structural Members**: Selecting cross-section options
- **Adaptive Panel**: Through Kangaroo simulations
