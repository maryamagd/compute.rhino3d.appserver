The project aims to give an overview of a public space canopy and its elements through progressing construction/ expansion phases, adding altering supports with each phase.

## Plugin
- Kangaroo Physics (for one aspect only, not completely relying on it)

## Data Flow
- **Expansion Phase**: Deployment apertures
- **Structural Members**: Selecting cross-section options
- **Movable Points**: For support location
